                    English Ivy (Hedera helix) is a versatile and hardy evergreen climbing plant native to Europe and
                    Western
                    Asia. Known for its attractive, glossy green leaves, which can be variegated with white or yellow,
                    it is
                    commonly used as a decorative indoor plant and ground cover outdoors. English Ivy is renowned for
                    its
                    ability to thrive in various light conditions, from bright, indirect light to partial shade, making
                    it a
                    popular choice for homes and gardens. It can be grown in pots, hanging baskets, or allowed to climb
                    trellises and walls.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/watering.png" width="35" alt="watering icon"> Watering</h3>
            <span>English Ivy prefers to be kept evenly moist, but it does not like to sit in water. It can tolerate
                some drying out between waterings,
                but prolonged dryness can cause the leaves to turn brown or crispy.</span>
            <h4>Frequency</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;">Water English Ivy when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. This
                typically means watering
                every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the climate and humidity levels. In warmer months or during active
                growth,
                the plant may require more frequent watering, while in winter, the frequency should be reduced as the
                plant
                enters a period of dormancy. It’s essential to monitor the soil moisture regularly to adjust the
                watering
                schedule as needed.
            </span>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;"> When watering, do so thoroughly until you see drainage from the bottom of the
                pot. This ensures that
                the roots receive adequate moisture. Be careful not to let the plant sit in standing water, as this can
                lead to root rot and other moisture-related issues. After watering, check that the excess water has been
                emptied from the saucer to maintain healthy root conditions.
            </span>
        </section>

        <section id="soil">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/soil.png" width="35" alt="soil icon"> Soil</h3>
            <span> English Ivy thrives in well-draining potting soil that retains some moisture while preventing
                waterlogging. A recommended mix includes peat moss, perlite, and compost, which provides nutrients
                while allowing for good aeration and drainage. The soil should be rich in organic matter to support
                healthy growth. Ensure that the pot has drainage holes to prevent excess water from accumulating, as
                stagnant water can lead to root rot.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/light.png" width="35" alt="light icon"> Light</h3>
            <span>This plant prefers bright, indirect light but can adapt to lower light conditions. While English
                Ivy can tolerate some shade, direct sunlight can scorch its leaves, leading to browning or crispy edges.
                If grown indoors, placing the plant near a window with filtered light or sheer curtains is ideal for
                providing the right balance of light without causing stress to the plant.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/temperature.png" width="35" alt="temperature icon"> Temperature</h3>
            <span>English Ivy prefers a comfortable temperature range of 50–70°F (10–21°C). It can tolerate cooler
                temperatures but should be protected from frost and extreme cold. During summer, it enjoys being
                outdoors
                in a partially shaded area, but be cautious of sudden temperature fluctuations. Keep the plant away from
                drafts, heating vents, and air conditioning units, which can create stress and cause leaf drop

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/fertilizer.png" width="35" alt="liquid fertilizer icon"> Fertilization</h3>
            <span>During the growing season (spring and summer), fertilize English Ivy every 4-6 weeks with a balanced
                liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength. This helps provide essential nutrients that promote healthy
                growth. In the fall and winter, when the plant’s growth slows down, reduce or stop fertilizing
                altogether
                to avoid nutrient buildup in the soil.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/shears.png" width="35" alt="pruning shears icon"> Pruning</h3>
            <span>Pruning is an essential part of maintaining the health and appearance of English Ivy. Regularly trim
                back long or leggy growth to encourage bushier growth and maintain a desired shape. Use clean, sharp
                scissors
                or pruning shears to make clean cuts. Additionally, remove any dead, yellowing, or diseased leaves to
                keep the
                plant healthy and prevent potential issues.
            </span>

                <h3><img src="../Images/icons/humidity.png" width="35" alt="humidity dew point icon"> Humidity</h3>
                <span>English Ivy prefers moderate to high humidity levels. If the air is too dry, especially in winter
                    due
                    to heating systems, the plant may show signs of stress such as browning leaf tips. To increase
                    humidity,
                    consider misting the plant occasionally, placing it on a pebble tray filled with water, or using a
                    humidifier
                    nearby. However, be cautious not to overwater, as increased humidity combined with excess moisture
                    can lead to
                    fungal problems.

                <span>Good air circulation is crucial for preventing mold, mildew, and other fungal diseases. Place the
                    plant
                    in a location with adequate airflow, but avoid exposing it to strong drafts or cold air, which can
                    lead to
                    stress and leaf drop. Ensure that the leaves have space to breathe and are not overcrowded, as this
                    can also
                    hinder air circulation.

            <span>English Ivy is relatively hardy but can attract common pests such as spider mites, aphids, and
                mealybugs.
                Regularly inspect the leaves for signs of infestation, such as webbing, sticky residue, or small
                insects.
                If pests are present, treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil, and consider wiping the
                leaves
                with a damp cloth to remove any pests. It’s also beneficial to keep the plant clean by dusting the
                leaves regularly.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/pot.png" width="35" alt="potted plant icon"> Repotting</h3>
            <span>English Ivy should be repotted every 1-2 years or when it becomes root-bound in its current pot.
                Choose
                a pot that is slightly larger than the current one to give the roots room to grow, ensuring it has
                drainage
                holes. When repotting, refresh the soil to provide new nutrients and support healthy growth. Repotting
                in the
                spring is ideal, as this coincides with the plant’s active growing season.
