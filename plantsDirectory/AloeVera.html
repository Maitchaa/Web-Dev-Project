                <div class="intro">
                    Aloe Vera is a popular succulent known for its thick, fleshy leaves that contain a soothing gel
                    often
                    used for skincare and medicinal purposes. Native to arid regions, Aloe Vera thrives in bright light
                    and requires minimal watering, making it a hardy, low-maintenance houseplant. It’s valued not only
                    for
                    its resilience but also for its natural healing properties, especially for burns and skin
                    irritation.
                    With proper care, Aloe Vera can live for years and even produce offsets, allowing for easy
                    propagation.

        <section id="watering" style="background-color: rgba(197, 237, 250, 0.6);">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/watering.png" width="35" alt="watering icon"> Watering</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera is a succulent and prefers to be watered infrequently, as it stores water in its thick
                leaves. The plant
                should be allowed to dry out completely between waterings.</span>
            <h4>Frequency</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;"> Aloe Vera needs infrequent but thorough watering. About every 2–3 weeks is
                sufficient, depending on
                the climate and humidity. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as Aloe Vera is
                drought-tolerant and can store water in its leaves. In winter, reduce watering frequency, as the plant’s
                growth naturally slows during this time
            </span>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;">To avoid rot, water Aloe Vera at the base of the plant rather than on its
                leaves. Pour water slowly
                until it drains out of the pot’s holes, then discard any excess water in the saucer. Avoid splashing
                water
                on the leaves, as moisture can lead to fungal growth or rot at the base of the leaves.
            </span>

        <section id="soil">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/soil.png" width="35" alt="soil icon"> Soil</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera requires a soil that drains quickly to prevent root rot. A cactus or succulent soil
                mix works best because it’s designed for fast drainage. For a DIY mix, combine regular potting
                soil with coarse sand and perlite in equal parts. This mix mimics the plant’s natural desert
                habitat by preventing moisture from accumulating around the roots. Planting Aloe Vera in a
                terracotta pot with drainage holes can also help absorb excess water and maintain ideal conditions
                for the roots.
            </span>

        <section id="light" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 127, 0.5);">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/light.png" width="35" alt="light icon"> Light</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera thrives in bright, indirect sunlight but can also handle a few hours of direct sunlight
                each day if it’s gradually exposed. Place it in a south- or west-facing window where it can receive
                4-6 hours of light. If the plant doesn’t get enough light, it may start to stretch or grow leggy as
                it reaches toward the light.
            </span>
        </section>

        <section id="temp">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/temperature.png" width="35" alt="temperature icon"> Temperature</h3>
            <span> Aloe Vera prefers temperatures between 55–80°F (13–27°C) and can adapt well to most indoor
                environments. However, it’s sensitive to frost and should be brought indoors if temperatures drop
                below 50°F (10°C). In warmer climates, it can also thrive outdoors but needs protection from
                sudden temperature fluctuations or prolonged cold.
            </span>

        <section id="fertilization" style="background-color: rgba(40, 114, 0, 0.45);">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/fertilizer.png" width="35" alt="liquid fertilizer icon"> Fertilization</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera doesn’t require heavy feeding. A balanced, diluted fertilizer applied once in the
                spring or summer is generally enough. Avoid fertilizing in the fall and winter when the plant’s
                growth slows. Using too much fertilizer can lead to salt buildup in the soil, which can harm the
                roots and affect the plant’s health.

        <section id="pruning">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/shears.png" width="35" alt="pruning shears icon"> Pruning</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera doesn’t need frequent pruning, but you can trim off any yellowed, dead, or damaged
                leaves at the base. Use a clean, sharp pair of scissors or pruning shears to make a clean cut
                close to the soil line. If you plan to harvest leaves for their gel, avoid cutting too many healthy
                leaves at once, as this may stress the plant.

                <h3><img src="../Images/icons/humidity.png" width="35" alt="humidity dew point icon"> Humidity</h3>
                <span>Aloe Vera prefers low to moderate humidity levels, as it’s adapted to dry climates. Humidity
                    isn’t usually a concern, and misting should be avoided, as this can introduce excess moisture that
                    can lead to fungal issues or rot.

                <h3><img src="../Images/icons/air.png" width="35" alt="air icon"> Air Circulation</h3>
                <span>Good airflow is important for preventing fungal issues and rot. Place Aloe Vera in a
                    well-ventilated
                    area but away from strong drafts or fans, which can dry it out too much. In humid climates, airflow
                    helps
                    to keep excess moisture from building up around the plant.

        <section id="pests">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/bug.png" width="35" alt="pest icon"> Pest Management</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera is generally pest-resistant, but it can occasionally attract pests like mealybugs, aphids,
                or scale. Check the plant regularly for any signs of pests, such as small white spots or sticky residue
                on
                the leaves. If pests are present, you can gently wipe the leaves with a cloth and apply insecticidal
                soap or
                neem oil as needed. Removing pests early helps prevent infestations from spreading.

        <section id="repot">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/pot.png" width="35" alt="potted plant icon"> Repotting</h3>
            <span>Aloe Vera should be repotted every 1–2 years or when it becomes root-bound. Repotting in the spring
                allows the plant to establish itself in
                new soil before its active growing season. Choose a pot that’s one size larger than the current one,
                with drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating.
                When repotting, use fresh cactus or succulent soil to support healthy growth and provide the plant with
                fresh nutrients.
