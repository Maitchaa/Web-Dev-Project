                <div class="intro">
                    The ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) is a hardy, low-maintenance houseplant known for its glossy,
                    dark green,
                    waxy leaves and upright growth habit. It thrives in low to bright, indirect light and is highly
                    tolerant of neglect,
                    making it ideal for beginners or people with busy schedules. ZZ plants prefer infrequent watering,
                    as they store water
                    in their thick, tuberous roots; let the soil dry out completely between waterings. They are
                    well-suited to average indoor
                    temperatures and humidity levels. The ZZ Plant is also known for being a great air purifier, helping
                    to remove toxins from the air.

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/watering.png" width="35" alt="watering icon"> Watering</h3>
            <span>ZZ plants are highly tolerant of dry conditions due to their thick, waxy leaves that help retain
                moisture.
                They store water in their rhizomes, making them very drought-tolerant. </span>
            <h4>Frequency</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;"> ZZ plants are drought-tolerant and should be watered when the soil is dry.
                Typically,
                this means watering every 2–3 weeks, depending on the environment’s temperature and humidity.
            </span>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <span style="padding: 30px;"> Water the ZZ plant thoroughly until water drains from the pot’s drainage
                holes.
                Ensure that the pot has good drainage to avoid water accumulating at the bottom, which can lead to root
                rot.
            </span>
        </section>

        <section id="soil">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/soil.png" width="35" alt="soil icon"> Soil</h3>
            <span>ZZ plants require well-draining soil to prevent root rot, as they are susceptible to overwatering.
                A cactus or succulent mix works well due to its light, airy texture. To further improve drainage, mix in
                perlite
                or coarse sand in a 1:1 ratio with the potting mix.
            </span>

            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/light.png" width="35" alt="light icon"> Light</h3>
            <span>PZZ plants thrive in bright, indirect light but can adapt to low light conditions. They are often used
                in spaces
                with minimal natural light due to their ability to survive in low-light environments.
            </span>

        <section id="temp">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/temperature.png" width="35" alt="temperature icon"> Temperature</h3>
            <span>ZZ plants prefer temperatures between 60–75°F (15–24°C), which is typical of most indoor environments.
                They are not
                frost-tolerant and should be kept in areas that stay above 45°F (7°C).
            </span>
        </section>

        <section id="fertilization" style="background-color: rgba(40, 114, 0, 0.45);">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/fertilizer.png" width=" 35" alt="liquid fertilizer icon"> Fertilization</h3>
            <span> During the growing season (spring and summer), fertilize once a month with a balanced, diluted liquid
                fertilizer,
                ideally with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10. A weak solution helps encourage healthy growth without
                overloading the plant with nutrients.

        <section id="pruning">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/shears.png" width="35" alt="pruning shears icon"> Pruning</h3>
            <span> ZZ plants are slow-growing, so pruning is typically minimal. Remove yellowing, dead, or damaged
                leaves by cutting them off
                at the base with sharp scissors or pruning shears.

                <span> ZZ plants are adaptable to a variety of humidity levels. They can thrive in low humidity
                    environments, making them
                    an excellent choice for homes and offices with dry air.

                <span>ZZ plants do not require high airflow but benefit from moderate circulation to keep the leaves
                    dust-free and healthy.

            <span>ZZ plants are naturally pest-resistant, but they can occasionally be affected by pests like aphids,
                mealybugs, or scale. Aphids are often found on new growth, while mealybugs can accumulate in the leaf
                joints.

        <section id="repot">
            <h3><img src="../Images/icons/pot.png" width="35" alt="potted plant icon"> Repotting</h3>
            <span> ZZ plants do not need frequent repotting and should only be repotted when they become root-bound.
                This usually happens every 2-3 years. They are slow growers, so they do not outgrow their pots quickly.
